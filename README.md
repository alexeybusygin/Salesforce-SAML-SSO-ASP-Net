# Salesforce-SAML-SSO-ASP-Net
Sample ASP.Net project for Salesforce SAML2 SSO implementation with Sustainsys.Saml2.Owin

This project was originally forked from https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/tree/master/Samples/SampleOwinApplication and adopted to 
the Salesforce SAML SSO. You will need to configure only 3 variables to make it up and running. The variables are in the 
/App_Start/Start.Auth.cs, but you can move them to Web.Config or any other suitable location for your project.
